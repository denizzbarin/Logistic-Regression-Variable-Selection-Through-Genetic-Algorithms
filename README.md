# Logistic-Regression-Variable-Selection-Through-Genetic-Algorithms
The purpose of this study is to find a subset of regressive variables which will yield to lower AIC/BIC. The default method for logistic regression is bacward elimination which relies on an heuristic approach. Genetic Algorithm is still heuristic although it provides a more sophisticated approach. The problem's complexity for finding the optimal set of variables is $2^k$ where $k$ is the number of variables in the data set which becomes NP hard for the datasets having categorical variables with too many categories due to AIC/BIC computation which measures the in sample fit of the model to the data. To find suboptimal solutions, heuristic approaches are used by default where GA yielded in set of featues with less AIC/BIC for the concerned data set.
